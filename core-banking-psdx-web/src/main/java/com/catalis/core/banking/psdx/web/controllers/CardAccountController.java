            ## Retrieve All Customer Card Accounts

            This endpoint retrieves all card accounts owned by a specific customer that are accessible under the provided consent.

            ### Description
            This operation is part of the Card Account Information Service under PSD2/PSD3 regulations. It allows 
            Third Party Providers (TPPs) to access a customer's card account information after obtaining explicit 
            consent from the customer.

            ### Request Headers
            * `X-Consent-ID` - The unique identifier of the consent that authorizes this access

            ### Query Parameters
            * `partyId` - The unique identifier of the customer whose card accounts are being retrieved

            ### Processing
            The system will:
            1. Validate the consent ID provided in the header
            2. Check that the consent is valid, active, and covers card account information access
            3. Verify that the consent is associated with the specified customer (partyId)
            4. Retrieve all card accounts that the customer owns and that are covered by the consent
            5. Filter out any card accounts that are not included in the consent's scope

            ### Response
            Returns an array of card account objects, each containing:
            * Card account identifier
            * Card type (e.g., credit, debit, prepaid)
            * Card product name
            * Card number (masked)
            * Currency
            * Card holder name
            * Status
            * Expiry date
            * Credit limit (for credit cards)

            ### Access Control
            * Access is only granted if a valid consent exists
            * Only card accounts specified in the consent scope are returned
            * The TPP must be authenticated and authorized

            ### Regulatory Compliance
            * This endpoint implements the Card Account Information Service as defined in PSD2/PSD3
            * Access is logged for regulatory reporting and audit purposes
            * Data minimization principles are applied (only necessary data is returned)
            * Sensitive card details are masked according to security standards

            ### Security Considerations
            * All requests must include a valid consent ID
            * Consent validation includes checking expiration and revocation status
            * Full card numbers are never exposed through the API
