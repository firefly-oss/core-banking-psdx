            ## Confirm Availability of Funds

            This endpoint checks whether a specific amount of funds is available on a customer's account.

            ### Description
            This operation is part of the Funds Confirmation Service (FCS) under PSD2/PSD3 regulations.
            It allows Third Party Providers (TPPs) to verify if a customer has sufficient funds for a 
            transaction without initiating an actual payment.

            ### Request Headers
            * `X-Consent-ID` - The unique identifier of the consent that authorizes this funds check

            ### Request Body
            The request must include:
            * Account reference (account identifier)
            * Amount and currency to check
            * Reference information for the potential transaction

            ### Processing
            The system will:
            1. Validate the consent ID provided in the header
            2. Check that the consent is valid, active, and covers funds confirmation
            3. Verify that the specified account is included in the consent's scope
            4. Check the current available balance on the account
            5. Compare the available balance with the requested amount
            6. Create a funds confirmation record with the result

            ### Response
            Returns a funds confirmation object containing:
            * Confirmation identifier
            * Result (true if funds are available, false if not)
            * Timestamp of the confirmation
            * Account reference
            * Amount and currency checked
            * Reference information

            ### Important Notes
            * A positive confirmation does not guarantee funds will be available at the time of an actual payment
            * No funds are reserved or blocked by this operation
            * The confirmation is a point-in-time check and may become outdated quickly

            ### Use Cases
            * Card-based payment instruments issuing funds checks before authorizing transactions
            * Pre-validation of funds availability before initiating a payment
            * Merchant verification of customer's ability to pay

            ### Regulatory Compliance
            * This endpoint implements the Funds Confirmation Service as defined in PSD2/PSD3
            * Access is logged for regulatory reporting and audit purposes
            * Explicit consent is required for funds confirmation

            ### Security Considerations
            * All requests must include a valid consent ID
            * Consent validation includes checking expiration and revocation status
            * Funds confirmation requests are monitored for suspicious patterns
            * Results are considered sensitive financial information

            ## Retrieve a Funds Confirmation Record

            This endpoint retrieves a previously created funds confirmation record by its unique ID.

            ### Description
            This operation is part of the Funds Confirmation Service (FCS) under PSD2/PSD3 regulations.
            It allows Third Party Providers (TPPs) to retrieve the details of a funds confirmation
            check that was previously performed.

            ### Request Headers
            * `X-Consent-ID` - The unique identifier of the consent that authorizes access to this funds confirmation

            * `fundsConfirmationId` - The unique identifier of the funds confirmation record to retrieve

            ### Processing
            The system will:

            * Amount and currency checked
            * Reference information

            ### Historical Context
            * Funds confirmation records are historical point-in-time checks
            * The result reflects the account balance at the time of the original check
            * Current account balance may differ from the time of the check

            ### Error Scenarios
            * If the funds confirmation doesn't exist, returns a 404 Not Found response
            * If the funds confirmation exists but is not covered by the consent, returns a 403 Forbidden response
            * If the consent is invalid or expired, returns a 401 Unauthorized response

            ### Regulatory Compliance
            * This endpoint implements the Funds Confirmation Service as defined in PSD2/PSD3
            * Access is logged for regulatory reporting and audit purposes
