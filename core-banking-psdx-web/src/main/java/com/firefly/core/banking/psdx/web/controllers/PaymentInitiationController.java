            ## Initiate a New Payment

            This endpoint initiates a new payment transaction based on the provided payment details.

            ### Description
            This operation is a core Payment Initiation Service (PIS) under PSD2/PSD3 regulations.
            It allows Third Party Providers (TPPs) to initiate payments on behalf of customers
            after obtaining explicit consent.

            ### Request Headers
            * `X-Consent-ID` - The unique identifier of the consent that authorizes this payment initiation

            ### Request Body
            The request must include payment details:
            * Debtor account information
            * Creditor account information
            * Payment amount and currency
            * Payment type (e.g., single, recurring, bulk)
            * Execution date
            * Remittance information
            * End-to-end identifier (if applicable)

            ### Processing
            The system will:
            1. Validate the consent ID provided in the header
            2. Check that the consent is valid, active, and covers payment initiation
            3. Verify that the payment details are valid and complete
            4. Check for sufficient funds (preliminary check)
            5. Create a payment record with status "RECEIVED"
            6. Initiate the Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) process if required

            ### Response
            Returns a payment object containing:
            * Payment identifier
            * Current status (initially "RECEIVED")
            * Creation timestamp
            * All payment details as provided in the request
            * Links to related resources (e.g., status check, authorization)

            ### Payment Lifecycle
            1. **RECEIVED** - Initial state after payment is created
            2. **PENDING** - Payment is pending authorization
            3. **AUTHORIZED** - Payment has been authorized but not yet executed
            4. **EXECUTED** - Payment has been successfully executed
            5. **REJECTED** - Payment has been rejected
            6. **CANCELLED** - Payment has been cancelled

            ### Regulatory Compliance
            * This endpoint implements the Payment Initiation Service as defined in PSD2/PSD3
            * Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) is required for payment authorization
            * Access is logged for regulatory reporting and audit purposes

            ### Security Considerations
            * All requests must include a valid consent ID
            * Consent validation includes checking expiration and revocation status
            * Payment details are validated for security and compliance
            * Anti-fraud checks may be performed

            * Status reason (if applicable, especially for rejected payments)
            * Additional status details (if available)

            ### Status Definitions
            * **RECEIVED** - Payment has been received but not yet processed
            * **PENDING** - Payment is awaiting authorization or processing
            * **AUTHORIZED** - Payment has been authorized but not yet executed
            * **EXECUTED** - Payment has been successfully executed
            * **REJECTED** - Payment has been rejected (with reason)
            * **CANCELLED** - Payment has been cancelled by the user or system

            ### Error Scenarios
            * If the payment doesn't exist, returns a 404 Not Found response
            * If the payment exists but is not covered by the consent, returns a 403 Forbidden response

            This operation is part of the Payment Initiation Service (PIS) under PSD2/PSD3 regulations.
            It completes the authorization process for a payment by applying the authentication code
            obtained through the Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) process.

            Returns the updated payment object with status changed to "AUTHORIZED".

            1. Payment is initiated (status: RECEIVED)

            3. Customer completes authentication and receives an authorization code

            6. Payment is executed (status will change to EXECUTED asynchronously)

            ### SCA Requirements
            * Strong Customer Authentication is mandatory for payment authorization under PSD2/PSD3
            * SCA typically involves two-factor authentication (2FA)
            * The authorization code has a limited validity period
            * Multiple failed authorization attempts may lock the payment

            ### Error Scenarios
            * If the payment doesn't exist, returns a 404 Not Found response
            * If the payment exists but is not covered by the consent, returns a 403 Forbidden response

            * Access is logged for regulatory reporting and audit purposes

            ### Security Considerations
            * All requests must include a valid consent ID
            * Authorization codes are single-use and time-limited
