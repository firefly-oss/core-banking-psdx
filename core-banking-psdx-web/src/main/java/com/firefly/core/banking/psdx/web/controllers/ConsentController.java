            ## Create a New Consent

            This endpoint creates a new consent record for a customer, allowing a Third Party Provider (TPP) to access their data.

            ### Description
            Consent is a fundamental concept in PSD2/PSD3 regulations, representing the customer's explicit permission 
            for a TPP to access their account information or initiate payments. This endpoint creates a new consent 
            record based on the customer's authorization.

            ### Request Body
            The request must include:
            * Customer identification (party ID)
            * TPP identification
            * Type of consent (account information, payment initiation, etc.)
            * Scope of access (which accounts, what information)
            * Validity period (start and end dates)

            ### Processing
            The system will:
            1. Validate the request data
            2. Verify that the TPP is authorized and active
            3. Check that the customer exists
            4. Create a new consent record with status "RECEIVED"
            5. Generate a unique consent identifier

            ### Response
            Returns the created consent object with:
            * Unique consent ID
            * Current status (initially "RECEIVED")
            * Creation timestamp
            * All consent details as provided in the request

            ### Business Rules
            * A consent is initially created with status "RECEIVED"
            * The consent requires customer authentication before becoming active
            * Consents have a limited validity period as specified in the request
            * Different consent types may have different validation rules

            ### Security Considerations
            * Consent creation should be logged for audit purposes
            * The TPP must be authenticated and authorized to create consents
            * Customer verification will be required in a subsequent step

            This operation allows TPPs and authorized users to access the complete details of a consent record.
            It's used to check the status, scope, and validity of a consent that was previously created.

            ### Path Parameters
            * `consentId` - The unique identifier of the consent to retrieve

            ### Processing
            The system will:
            1. Validate the provided consent ID
            2. Check if the consent exists in the system
            3. Verify that the requester has permission to view the consent

            This operation allows authorized users to view all consents that a customer has granted 
            to various TPPs. This is useful for customer support, consent management, and regulatory 
            reporting purposes.

            ### Query Parameters
            * `partyId` - The unique identifier of the customer whose consents are being retrieved

            ### Processing
            The system will:
            1. Validate the provided party ID
            2. Verify that the requester has permission to view the customer's consents
            3. Retrieve all consent records associated with the customer
            4. Filter the results based on the requester's access rights

            ### Response
            Returns an array of consent records, each containing:
            * Consent ID and status

            * Administrators can access all consents for any customer

            ### Performance Considerations
            * For customers with many consents, consider implementing pagination
            * Results may be filtered based on consent status or TPP if needed

            ### Security Considerations
            * Access to customer consent information should be strictly controlled
            * All access attempts should be logged for audit purposes

            This operation allows for updating the status of a consent throughout its lifecycle.
            Consent status transitions are strictly controlled according to PSD2/PSD3 regulations
            and business rules.

            ### Response
            Returns the updated consent record with the new status.

            ### Status Transition Rules
            * Only certain status transitions are allowed (e.g., "RECEIVED" → "VALID", "VALID" → "REVOKED")
            * Some status changes require specific authentication or authorization
            * Certain status changes may be irreversible (e.g., "REVOKED" cannot be changed)
            * Status changes may trigger notifications to the customer and/or TPP

            ### Regulatory Implications
            * Status changes must comply with PSD2/PSD3 requirements
            * All status changes must be properly documented and auditable
            * Certain status changes may require reporting to regulatory authorities

            This operation allows customers or authorized administrators to revoke a previously granted consent.
            Revocation is an important right under PSD2/PSD3 regulations, allowing customers to withdraw

            * The revocation process must be simple and straightforward

            ### Security Considerations
            * Revocation should be strictly controlled but easily accessible to customers
