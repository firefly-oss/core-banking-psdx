            ## Register a new Third Party Provider

            This endpoint allows for the registration of a new Third Party Provider (TPP) in the system.

            ### Description
            TPPs are entities that provide payment initiation or account information services to customers.
            Registration is required before a TPP can access any PSD2/PSD3 APIs.

            ### Request Details
            The request must include:
            * TPP name and identification details
            * Contact information
            * Regulatory information including authorization number
            * Certificate details for secure communication

            ### Processing
            The system will:
            1. Validate the TPP's registration information
            2. Check for existing registrations to prevent duplicates
            3. Generate a unique API key for the TPP
            4. Store the TPP's information securely

            Returns the registered TPP information including the generated API key.

            This operation allows authorized administrators to temporarily disable a TPP's ability

            ### Description
            This operation allows authorized administrators to enable a TPP's ability to access the APIs.
            This is typically used when onboarding a new TPP, or reactivating a previously suspended TPP
            after resolving any issues that led to the suspension.

            ### Description
            This operation allows authorized administrators to permanently disable a TPP's ability 
            to access the APIs. This is typically used when a TPP is no longer authorized to provide 
            services, has violated terms of service, or has ceased operations.

            ### Path Parameters
            * `providerId` - The unique identifier of the TPP to revoke

            ### Processing

            This operation verifies that an API key belongs to a registered TPP and that the TPP 
            is currently active in the system. This endpoint is typically used by API gateways and 
            authentication services to validate incoming requests from TPPs.
