            ## Retrieve All Customer Accounts

            This endpoint retrieves all accounts owned by a specific customer that are accessible under the provided consent.

            ### Description
            This operation is a core Account Information Service (AIS) under PSD2/PSD3 regulations. It allows 
            Third Party Providers (TPPs) to access a customer's account information after obtaining explicit 
            consent from the customer.

            ### Request Headers
            * `X-Consent-ID` - The unique identifier of the consent that authorizes this access

            ### Query Parameters
            * `partyId` - The unique identifier of the customer whose accounts are being retrieved

            ### Processing
            The system will:
            1. Validate the consent ID provided in the header
            2. Check that the consent is valid, active, and covers account information access
            3. Verify that the consent is associated with the specified customer (partyId)
            4. Retrieve all accounts that the customer owns and that are covered by the consent
            5. Filter out any accounts that are not included in the consent's scope

            ### Response
            Returns an array of account objects, each containing:
            * Account identifier
            * Account type (e.g., current, savings, credit card)
            * Currency
            * Account name/description
            * Status
            * Basic account details

            ### Access Control
            * Access is only granted if a valid consent exists
            * Only accounts specified in the consent scope are returned
            * The TPP must be authenticated and authorized

            ### Regulatory Compliance
            * This endpoint implements the Account Information Service as defined in PSD2/PSD3
            * Access is logged for regulatory reporting and audit purposes
            * Data minimization principles are applied (only necessary data is returned)

            ### Security Considerations
            * All requests must include a valid consent ID
            * Consent validation includes checking expiration and revocation status
            * Access is monitored for suspicious patterns
